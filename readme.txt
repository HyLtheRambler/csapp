Here are the self learning materials for CSAPP.

target1.tar is the target to attack in Attacklab.

Datalab, bomblab, attacklab, archlab, cachelab, shlab and proxylab materials are
downloaded from the book Website and are still good after all the years. Writeups are in the same directory for your convenience.

The shlab has 16 trace files for you to check the correctness of your implementation of the tiny shell. You'll have to do it manually though as there is no autograder.

The malloclab-handout.tar from the book website lacks necessary trace files to perform autograding. So I downloaded another version of malloclab from https://github.com/Halbmond/Introduction-to-Computer-Systems. This is the 2016(?) PKU-ICS version of malloc lab with complete trace directory to perform the autograding. It's definitely the most difficult lab among the eight. In the end I got 85/100 perf index after implementing segregated free list with LIFO policy introduced in the slides.
